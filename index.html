      	              <font size="8">T</font>he modern holiday of <b>Mother's Day</b> was first celebrated in <b>1908</b>, when Anna Jarvis held a memorial for her mother at St Andrew's Methodist Church in Grafton, West Virginia.St Andrew's Methodist Church now holds the International Mother's Day Shrine. Her campaign to make Mother's Day a recognized holiday in the United States began in <b>1905</b>, the year her mother, Ann Reeves Jarvis, died. Ann Jarvis had been a peace activist who cared for wounded soldiers on both sides of the American Civil War, and created Mother's Day Work Clubs to address public health issues. She and another peace activist and suffragette Julia Ward Howe had been urging for the creation of a Mother’s Day dedicated to peace. <b>40 years</b> before it became an official holiday, Ward Howe had made her Mother’s Day Proclamation in <b>1870</b>, which called upon mothers of all nationalities to band together to promote the “amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.” Anna Jarvis wanted to honor this and to set aside a day to honor all mothers because she believed a mother is "the person who has done more for you than anyone in the world".
